Hello, if you are reading this it is because you are as interested as I am in the Cardano ecosystem.


The objective of this post is, in addition to welcoming you to my pool page, it is to show you a little about what I am working on and how I use the profits generated by the pool.


The main objective of this pool, in addition to supporting the decentralization of cardano, is the development of applications to make the cardano ecosystem more practical.


My current goal is focused on [CVM](https://github.com/orelvis15/cvm), an application that tries to solve the tediousness of setting up a cardano pool either by compiling or downloading the latest released versions of the cardano node.


In future posts I will be publishing the new CVM updates and tutorials on how to use it.


That would be all, I hope that if you are a pool administrator you take a tour of [CVM](https://github.com/orelvis15/cvm) and leave me your comments about it.


**Thank you very much!**.
