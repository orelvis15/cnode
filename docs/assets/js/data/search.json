On this occasion I wanted to announce the new release of CVM and tell you about the new functionality that will allow us to save much more time installing our own pool.What’s new in this version?Now cvm has support for downloading cardano-node builds, these builds are offered by IOHK in every release.Now this is the default behavior so the instructions changed a bit.Time to prepare the node for the execution of cardano you will have 2 options:1 - If you want to prepare the node to use only the compiled ones that the IOHK guys offer us, it would be cvm init. &gt; Average time 25 seconds2 - If you want to prepare the node to compile each version of cardano you want to install it would be using cvm init -b. &gt; Average time 1.5 minutesNow to install cardano-node on our server we also have two options.1 - If you want to install it using the compilers published by IOHK you just have to run cvm install 1.35.3. Average time 30 seconds2 - If what you want is to compile it, then you will need to add the -b option, as in the previous case cvm install -b 1.35.3. Average time 145 minutesOther changes The cvm list command was changed to cvm ls since it is more intuitive.Next stepsI am currently working on restructuring cvm outputs, this will allow adding future features that need to use progress bars or some kind of asynchronous indicator.Any suggestion or issue you have, do not hesitate to leave it on the CVM page on githubThat was all for this release. Cheers!." }, { "title": "Compiled cardano-node using CVM", "url": "/pool/posts/CVM-get-started/", "categories": "cvm", "tags": "cvm, stakepool, release", "date": "2022-07-18 20:55:00 +0800", "snippet": " After version 0.3.0 of CVM several changes were made that affect the commands, any questions visit this post Release Cardano Version Manager v0.3.0.StartingHello again, this time I wanted to show you a tutorial on how to build your own cardano node using CVM.What we will cover in this tutorial Server configuration to run the cardano node Cardano Server Installation Version managementThat we will not cover Server operating system installation Server security Post sync ledger setupEnvironment in which we will workVirtual machine, 16gb Ram, 4 Cores, Ubuntu 22.04let’s start: Installing CVMTo install cvm we just have to execute the following line in our terminal.curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orelvis15/cvm/master/install.sh -sSf | bash &amp;&amp; source \"$HOME\"/.cvm/envOnce the execution is finished you should have an output like thisLet’s run cvm help to verify that the installation was successful.Initial settings for using CVMCVM creates the folder structure needed to start the cardano node in the /opt directory, we need to make sure that the current user has write permissions to this directory.We add the current user in the sudo group.sudo adduser [user] sudoReplace [user] with the user, in our case it would be sudo adduser orelvis sudo.We add the sudo group as owner of the /opt directorysudo chown -R root:sudo /optWe assign read/write permissions to the user and group owners of the /opt directorysudo chmod -R 775 /optWe run ls -la and if all went well we should have an output like this.Preparing the server with CVMTo be able to use a cardano node we need to install certain dependencies and download several configuration files, we will be able to do all this with the cvm init commandcvm initThis command will do the following. Install all the necessary dependencies to run and compile the cardano node. Create the necessary folder structure in the /opt directory Download the configuration files published by IOK. Download the scripts published by the guild-operator community to manage our node.If all went well you should see an output like this.Compiling Cardano nodeThe safest way to use cardano node binaries is if we compile it ourselves, there is the option recommended by the community, that’s why this functionality is built into CVM.In the last section we prepared our server to compile cardano node without problems.We run the command cvm install x.x.x where x.x.x is the cardano version we want to install, if we only want to install the latest version we can run cvm install and cvm will find the latest version version available.cvm installThis command will perform the following actions. Clone the cardano node repository with the latest changes. Makes sure that it is in the tag of the version that was passed by parameters. Update Cabal packages. Compile the cardano node. Create a folder in /opt/cardano/bin with the name of the version that was installed and copy the generated binaries into it.Once finished you should have something like this.If we now execute *cvm ls we will see that we have an output similar to this.cvm lsStarting the nodeWe already have node installed on our server, now we need to get it up and running.first we are going to run cvm use x.x.x.cvm use 1.35.0This command will do the following: Save as the version of cardano to execute the pass by parameters. In case the cardano service does not exist, it will be created It will restart the systemctl daemon to get the changes in the serviceThis step requires administrator access, it is common to ask for the root passwordYou should have an output like thisIf we now execute cvm list we should get an output similar to this.Verifiquemos que el sistema está reconociendo el nodo de cardano y la cardano cli.cardano-node --versioncardano-clie --versionNow everything is ready to start with the synchronization of the node.We start the cardano node servicecvm startWe check that the service is runningsystemctl cnode statusMonitoring synchronizationWe can keep track of the synchronization with the ledger using the guild-operator community scriptsWe access the scripts directory in /opt/cardano.cd /opt/cardano/scripts2 - Now we run gLiveView./gLiveView.shYou should see something like this" } ]
